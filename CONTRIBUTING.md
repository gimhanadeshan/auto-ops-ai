# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Auto-Ops-AI! A few guidelines to get you started:

- Fork the repository and open a pull request against `main`.
- Keep changes focused and small; prefer multiple small PRs over a single large PR.
- Run tests locally before opening a PR: `cd backend && pytest`.
- For frontend changes: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` to test locally.
- Follow the existing code style. Use `black` for Python formatting.

If you'd like to add major features or architectural changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
