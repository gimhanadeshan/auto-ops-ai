# Example environment variables for the frontend (Vite)
# Copy this file to `.env` in the `frontend/` folder and edit values as needed.
# Do NOT commit your real secrets. This file is safe to commit because it contains no secrets.

# Base URL for backend API (include the /api/v1 prefix used by the backend)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1

# Optional: custom frontend port used by Vite (if you run `vite --port 5173` it's the default)
# VITE_DEV_PORT=5173

# Notes:
# - Vite exposes env vars prefixed with VITE_ to import.meta.env in the client code.
# - If you change the port or host the frontend on a different origin, add that origin to
#   backend `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` so CORS requests are allowed (e.g. http://localhost:5173).
